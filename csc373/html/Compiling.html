<center><h3>Quick Guide to Compiling C</h3></center>
<p>
Let's assume that you have the GNU compiler (gcc) installed and are ready to go
and that nums.c, one of the files in the ZIP for the first class, is to be
compiled. At the command line (with % as the prompt) we type
</p>
<p>
   % gcc nums.c
</P>
<p>
and get a.out as the executable output. (In Windows, the executable is a.exe.) We then can execute a.out
</p>
<p>
   % a.out
</p>
<p>
This is inconvenient in that every compiled source file would wind up with the
same name: a.out. We can specify the output file name. The command
</p>
<p>
   % gcc -o nums nums.c
</p>
<p>
now creates an executable named nums. The -o flag can go anywhere:
</p>
<p>
   % gcc nums.c -o nums
</p>
<p>
The make command can be used as shorthand for "gcc -o...". For example,
</p>
<p>   
% make nums
</p>
<p>
looks for an input file named nums.c and then compiles the file to produce
nums as the executable.
</p>

<p>
On a Windows box, the gcc command will be 
</p>
<p>
   % gcc-3
</p>
<p>
or 
</p>
<p>
   % gcc-4
</p>
<p>
depending on which version you installed. The default output file will be named
a.exe instead of a.out.
