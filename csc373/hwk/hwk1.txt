                                       Homework 1
Points: 100
Due: Tuesday, June 25th, before midnight

Grading rubric:

  There are six questions in all. The first four, all of
  which are in the first C function, are worth 20 points
  each. Each of the "mystery" functions is worth 10 points.
  Points are deducted in the graded copy. At the end of 
  course, the points per homework are added and mapped to 
  a letter grade.

  For each question, there are two parts: (1) the answer
  and (2) the reasons in support of the answer. The answer
  is worth 10% and the reasons are worth 90%.

  Sample question and answer:

  C has an addition operator +. In arithmetic, the sum of
  any two positive integers is greater than either:

   (n + m) > n for n, m > 0
   (n + m) > m for n, m > 0

  Is this the case in C? Justify your answer.

  Answer: 
  No. Assume that m and n are unsigned ints, each greater 
  than 0 in value. There are two cases to consider:

  Case 1: (m + n) <= UINT_MAX
  Case 2: (m + n) >  UINT_MAX

  For Case 1, (m + n) > m and (m + n) > n. The smallest
  value for m or n would be 1, by assumption; and the
  largest value for the other then would be UINT_MAX - 1 to
  ensure that the sum is less than or equal to UINT_MAX.
  For Case 2, however, m > (m + n) and n > (m + n) because
  "overflow" occurs: sizeof(unsigned) is not big enough to
  represent the arithmetic value (m + n).

  The following program illustrates, with m set to UINT_MAX
  and n set to 1. In this case, (m + n) is 0. If m is held
  constant at UINT_MAX and n > 0, then 

    (m + n) = n - 1.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>

int main() {
  unsigned m = UINT_MAX;
  unsigned n = 1;  
  printf("m = %u\n", m);
  printf("n = %u\n", n);
  printf("m + n = %u\n", m + n);
  return 0;
}

/* Output (formatted for readability):

m     = 4,294,967,295
n     =             1
m + n =             0

*/

This answer would get full credit and, because of the code,
probably bonus points as well.

/* Answer the questions below. For each answer, explain whether
   the expression shown evaluates to true (non-zero) or false (zero). For example,
   you'd say that 

     (n1 < n2) == (-n1 > -n2)

   always evaluates to true or, for some values, might evaluate to false. 

   A perfect score requires the right answer with a solid explanation.
   The right answer without a solid explanation is worth very little: 10%. 
   The emphasis, in other words, is on the explanation.

   The code can be compiled and executed, of course. */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>
int main() {
  int n1 = -1;
  int n2 = 2;

  unsigned int u1 = (unsigned int) n1;  
  unsigned int u2 = (unsigned int) n2;

  /* Is result always 1? Explain. */
  int result = (n1 < n2) == (-n1 > -n2);
  printf("(%d < %d) == (-%d > -%d) evaluates to %d\n", 
	 n1, n2, n1, n2, result);

  /* Is result always 0? Explain. */
  result = ~n1 + ~n2 == ~(n1 + n2);
  printf("(~%d + ~%d) == ~(%d + %d) evaluates to %d\n", 
	 n1, n2, n1, n2, result);

  /* Is result always 1? Explain. */
  result = ((n1 >> 1) << 1) <= n1;
  printf("((%d >> 1) << 1) <= %d evaluates to %d\n",
	 n1, n1, result);











  /* Is result always 1? Explain. */
  /** On left hand side, the expression (int) (u1 - u2) means that
      the subtraction of u2 from u1 is done and then this result is
      cast to an int, that is, a signed int.
  **/
  result = ((int) (u1 - u2)) == -(n2 - n1);
  printf("((int) (%u - %u)) == -(%d - %d) evaluates to %d\n",
	 u1, u2, n2, n1, result);

  return 0;
}

/* What does the function mystery do? 

   To get the idea of what constitutes a good explanation, consider
   the simpler function

       int mys(int n) { 
          int ans = n * 2; 
          ans += 1;
       }

   The function is needlessly long for emphasis. A perfectly good
   explanation of what the function does is:

       The function mys doubles its argument, adds 1, and 
       returns the result.

       The argument and return value are signed integers.

       For example, given 4 as the argument, mys returns 9;
       given -3 as the argument, mys returns -5; and so on.

   For more complicated examples, as the one below, you can 
   explain in more detail. The goal is to explain (a) what the
   function does in general and (b) how the function does what
   it does.

#include <stdio.h>
unsigned int mystery1(unsigned int  a,       
		      unsigned int  b,      
		      unsigned char c) {    /* a char is 8 bits */
  unsigned char* ptr = (unsigned char*) &a; /* make ptr point to a */
  unsigned int ret_val;
  if (b >= sizeof(unsigned int)) b = 0;
  *(ptr + b) = c;  /* In general, if ptr is a pointer, then *ptr is the
                      value pointed at. So, for example, if 

                        int n = 27;
                        int* ptr = &n;

                                    0x1234

                      with 0x1234 as the address of n, then *ptr is 27.  */

  /* ptr is of type unsigned char*, that is, pointer to unsigned char; but
     the function is supposed to return an int. So, first, we cast ptr's
     value to unsigned int* (pointer to unsigned int):

              (unsigned int*) ptr

     However, we need to return an unsigned int, not a pointer to an 
     unsigned int. So we dereference the pointer:

             *((unsigned int*) ptr)

     If we just did

             *ptr

     we'd get an unsigned char rather than the unsigned int that we want.

/* What does the function mystery2 do?
   You should answer at two levels. First, explain in general what it 
   does by giving some sample inputs and outputs. For example, on a 
   sample run I got

            1234 ===> -771489792

   as my output. How did the function mystery map 1234 to -771489792?
   If you know how the function works, you might also suggest a better
   name for it.

   Second, document the lines of code in the function. There are four
   such lines, involving shifts and logical-ands. What do they do?
