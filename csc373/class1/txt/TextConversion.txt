                           File Formats for the ZIP files

My class handouts and code are packed into a ZIP file using a standard
ZIP utility. Inside the ZIP are either text files or other ZIP files.
Sometimes, as in the very first file Class1.zip, there is an embedded
Zip file. Any standard Zip utility can be used to unpack the archive.

Unix-type systems and Windows have different conventions for text files.
It's possible that my text files may be single line on a Windows box. This
happens, in particular, with Notepad. A better editor (for instance, Notepad++)
usually recognizes the difference and displays the text on multiple lines. The
same goes for MS Word.

Also, there are many sites and tools for conversions, among them:

   http://www.fileformat.info/convert/text/unix2dos.tr
   http://www.sg-chem.net/u2win/

Of course, I can't guarantee any of these: use at your own risk but they
seem fine from my simple testing.

My text files originate mostly from a Unix box because I use a helpful
utility to put in line numbers. It's important to resolve quickly any
glitches there may be in downloading, unpacking, and reading my files.
