-- Core

Since the advent of multi-core technology, such as dual-cores and quad-cores, the term "processor" is 
used to describe both a logical execution unit and a physical chip. A multi-core chip has more than
one core in either sense. A core, in turn, comprises a logical execution unit containing an L1 cache and 
the functional units that do the computing. A core executes statements in some program, statements grouped 
into "threads of execution".

-- Chip

A chip is a physical integrated circuit (IC) on a computer. 

-- Socket

A socket, in this context, is a physical connection on a computer motherboard to one or more chips (ICs).
A motherboard may have multiple sockets, each of which can connect to multi-core chips. 

-- Process

A process is a "program in execution", which has its own address space: the address space comprises the
addresses that the executing program is allowed to touch through any combination of reads and writes. Any two
processes are (normally) independent in that each has its own indepedent address space and its own state.
 
-- Thread

A thread is a sequence of executable statements within a process. All threads in the same process share the same
address space.

-- N-way Node

Multi-core computing nodes have execution units, each a core. A computer with 8 cores would be described as an 8-way node. 
This machine could have 8 independent processes running simultaneously. A 32-core system is a 32-way node; and so on.

-- L1 and L2 cache

A cache is a copy of (main) memory. An L1 cache is on the same chip (IC) as the processor that the node supports. 
L1 caches typically come in two flavors: L1i (instruction cache) and L1d (data cache). L1 caches, on everyday machines,
are typically in the K range with respect to size.

An L2 cache typically is "off chip" rather than "on chip" and usually is shared among processors. L2 caches are 
usually in the M range with respect to size; and these caches typically share data and instructions.
