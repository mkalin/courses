<center><h3>Installing the Cygwin Compiler</h3></center>
<p>
The URL <a href = 'http://www.cygwin.com'>www.cygwin.com</a> provides standard Unix utilities for Windows. Included
in the distribution is the so-called GNU C compiler, gcc. The Cygwin site
has a startup file that you can download and execute. This, in turn, will
install the Cygwin utilities on your computer.
</p>
<p>
However, the gcc compiler is not part of the standard or default install.
During the install, you'll get a list of packages. Expand the Devel (for
Development) tab and pick gcc, the C compiler, as one of the packages to
include. Also include the debugger, gdb. Once installed (for example, in C:\cygin), the directory
</p>
<p>
C:\cygwin\bin
</p>
<p>
will contain the executables, including gcc.exe. It's easiest to set your
system path to include C:\cywin\bin so that you can, for example, do
</p>
<p>
gcc hello.c
</p>
<p>
from any command-line prompt. For Windows, the installed executable 
may include the version. For instance:
</p>
<p>
gcc-4 hello.c
</p>
<p>
Try the versionless gcc first and the versioned one if that should fail.
</p>
<p>
Cygwin includes a "cygwin command-prompt," which simulates a Unix bash shell.
