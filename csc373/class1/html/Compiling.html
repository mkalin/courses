<center><h3>Quick Guide to Compiling C</h3></center>
<p>
Let's assume that you have the GNU compiler (gcc) installed and are ready to go
and that <em>nums.c</em>, one of the files in the ZIP for the first class, is to be
compiled. At the command line (with % as the prompt) we type
</p>
<p>
   % gcc nums.c
</P>
<p>
and get <em>a.out</em> as the executable output. (In Windows, the executable is <em>a.exe</em>.) We then can execute <em>a.out</em>:
</p>
<p>
   % a.out
</p>
<p>
This is inconvenient in that every compiled source file would wind up with the
same name: <em>a.out</em>. We can specify the output file name. The command
</p>
<p>
   % gcc -o nums nums.c
</p>
<p>
now creates an executable named <em>nums</em>. The -o flag can go anywhere:
</p>
<p>
   % gcc nums.c -o nums
</p>
<p>
The make command can be used as shorthand for "gcc -o...". For example,
</p>
<p>   
% make nums
</p>
<p>
looks for an input file named <em>nums.c</em> and then compiles the file to produce
nums as the executable.
