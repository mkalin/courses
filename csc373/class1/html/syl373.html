<h2>CSC 373: Computer Systems 1</h2><br/>
</center>

<h3>Course Overview</h3>
<p>
This course covers the concepts underlying all computer systems with an emphasis on 
how such systems affect the 
correctness, performance, and utility of application programming. The course topics include 
machine organization, information representations, assembly language and debuggers, 
memory hierarchy, virtual memory, 
pipelining, 
basic system-level I/O, and networking. The course also introduces C-language programming.
</p>

<p>
<h3>Learning Goals</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Understand the basic architecture and machine organization of a modern compupter system,
      from production-grade server through hand-held device, in particular the differences
      among the application, operating system, and hardware/resource levels.</li>
  <li>Recognize and apply the distinction between external and internal data representation.</li>
  <li>Become proficient in working in binary and hexadecimal.</li>
  <li>Distinguish among the standard data types available on modern systems.</li>
  <li>Analyze and explain the programming trade-offs involved in data type selection.</li>
  <li>Become fluent in the acroynms and technical vocabularly used to describe modern systems, including: 
      CPU, ALU, CU, TLB, L1/L2 cache, virtual and physical address space, 
      main and cache memory, cache organization, I/O subsystem, CPU scheduling, multiprocessing,
      and multithreading.</li>
  <li>Be able to read and document IA32/IA64 assembler; and be able to write short code
      segments in one of them.</li>
  <li>Learn to write, compile, link, and execute programs written in standard C.</li>
  <li>Explain the advantages and challenges of pipelined architectures.</li>
  <li>Comprehend and apply different metrics for <em>performance</em> in the context of 
      program execution.</li>
  <li>Understand the basics of process structure.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>
The firm prerequisite is programming experience: two courses in the same programming language 
(e.g., Python, Java, C++) together with a course in data structures/algorithms. The
course also presupposes a 1-course background in discrete mathematics. 
The course relies heavily on coding examples 
written in C. Several assignments involve the compilation and execution of C programs; other
assignments require programming in C. (C and C++ are distinct languages. This 
course uses C rather than C++.)
Although no knowledge of C in particular is assumed, <em>the ability to program 
is assumed</em>.
</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>
Because Summer courses are only five weeks long, there will not be a midterm exam. Instead, 
there will be weekly homework exercises and discussion of these in the following week. <br/>
The final exam is a quality-control exam with material drawn from and, therefore, closely 
related to the questions on the homework. All homework 
must be submitted on time so that the answers can be published in timely manner
and discussed in class. Answers will
be posted on-line after the submission deadline. 
There will be one make-up homework, the grade for which will be substituted automatically
for one regular homework with a lower grade. (Each assignment is worth 100 points.)
</p>

<p>
The grading will be determined as follows:
<ul>
<li><b>Homework:</b> 2/3
<li><b>Final Exam:</b> 1/3
</ul>
A student must pass the final exam to pass the course.
</p>
<p>
Students are expected to do their own homework, of course.
