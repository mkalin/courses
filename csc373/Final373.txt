                                          Final Exam

Instructions: Open book, open notes, simple calculator allowed. No computers.

Please respond to all questions. Assume throughout the exam that C uses
2's complement representation for signed integers.

1. Consider the code segment

       /* get_number_from_user prompts the user for a C int
          and returns this int.
       */
       int n = get_number_from_user();

       /* result will be either 1 (true) or 0 (false) */
       int result = (~n == -n); 

   For any value of n, is it possible for result to be 1? Explain.
   (In the == expression it's "tilde n" on the left and "negative sign n" on
   the right, in case you're having trouble reading the symbols.)












2. The function 

     void show_bytesBE(char* msg, unsigned char* ptr, int how_many) {
       printf("%s ==> ", msg);
       int i;
       for (i = how_many - 1; i >= 0; i--) printf(" %.2x", ptr[i]);
       printf("\n");
     }

   has "BE" in the name to indicate "big endian." Given the code segment

     int n = 0xaabbccdd;
     show_bytesBE("n", (unsigned char*) &n, sizeof(int));

   the function show_bytesBE produces, on my home computer, the output

     n ==>  aa bb cc dd

   Note that the most significant bytes (in this case, the hex aa) are on the
   left and that the least significant bytes (in this case, the hex dd) are on
   the right.

   Would this output be produced on any platform that supports C? Explain?









3. Consider the function

     int foo(short int a, short int b) {
       printf("sizeof(short) is %u\n", sizeof(short));
       printf("a's address is %u\nb's address is %u\n", &a, &b);
       int c = a - b + (2 * a);
       return c;
     }

   On a sample call, I get the output

       sizeof(short) is 2         /* 2 bytes == 16 bits */
       a's address is 3220509190  /* 3,220,509,190 */
       b's address is 3220509188  /* 3,220,509,188 */

   (The comments, of course, were added later.)

   What does the output tell us about alignment with respect to how
   the compiler translated this code? Explain.






4. Assume that sizeof(int) == sizeof(float) == 4 bytes or 32 bits. This is 
   typical in a C implementation. Now I declare two variables

          int n;
          float f;

   Now pick one of the following three options and defend it, based on the 
   assumption given above:

      (a) The number of distinct values that the floating-point variable f
          can hold is roughly the same number of distinct values that the
          integer variable n can hold, although the ranges of these 
          values may differ.

      (b) The floating-point variable f can hold significantly many more
          distinct values than can the integer variable n.

      (c) The integer variable n can hold significantly many more distinct
          values than can the floating-point variable f.

   Far more important than the option you pick are the reasons you offer
   in defense of this option.




5. Consider the function

     unsigned int bar(unsigned int n) {
        /* sizeof(unsigned int) == 4 */
        printf("sizeof(unsigned int) == %u\n", 
               sizeof(unsigned int)); 
        unsigned char* ptr = (unsigned char*) &n;
        unsigned char t1 = *(ptr + sizeof(unsigned int) - 1);
        unsigned char t2 = *(ptr + 1);
        *(ptr + sizeof(unsigned int) - 1) = t2;
        *(ptr + 1) = t1;
        return n;  
     }


   In a sample run, I called the function in this code segment

     unsigned int k = 0xff11aa22;
     printf("k in hex == %x\n", k);  /* output: k in hex == ff11aa22 */
     unsigned int r = bar(k);
     printf("r in hex == %x\n", r);

   What does the second printf statement output? Explain why. In 
   particular, would the output be the same on every platform? If not,
   what can you say would always be the case about what the second
   printf statement outputs?
  

6. Here's a depiction of the IA32 stack at a certain point in a process's
   execution, in particular during the invocation of the function foo. To
   the left of each stack location is its address in hex. The register
   %edx is also depicted. For simplicity, let's assume that %edx holds 0
   to begin.

       Address   Stack contents
               +---------------+
       0x123C  | caller's %ebp |<----------  foo's %ebp
               +---------------+  
       0x1238  |      7        |
               +---------------+
       0x1234  |      9        |             +------------+
               +---------------+             |     0      |
                                             +------------+
                                                 %edx

  Now consider is code segment of assembler:

       movl -8(%ebp), %edx
       leal -4(%ebp), %eax
       addl %edx, (%eax)

  Show any changes to either %edx or the stack and explain.


7. Same starting assumptions as in question 6. Now, however, the assembler changes
   to 
        movl -8(%ebp), %edx
        leal -4(%ebp), %eax
        addl %eax, %edx

   Show any changes to either %edx or the stack and explain.




8. Assume that an L1 cache is set associative with two lines per
   set. There are three sets: S0, S1, and S2. Below is a reference string, with
   each number representing the address of one word. For simplicity, assume that
   a cache line holds only one word and that words are loaded individually into
   the cache. The set index is the word address mod 3. So, for example, if the
   reference string contained the address 38, we'd have 

          38 % 3 == 2

   because 3 goes into 38 twelve times with a remainder of 2. Keep in mind that
   
           0 % 3 == 0

   Reference string: 

       31 26 2 11 22 12 4 18 17 39 28 11 22 12 4 31 26 39 17


   Initially the cache is empty. For each address in the reference string, show
   whether it's a HIT or a MISS and show where it goes into the cache. In case of
   conflict, resolve the conflict using LRU.






9. Explain how the following program generates the output given. In particular,
   explain what's going on in the comp function that is the qsort callback.

#include <stdio.h>


/* the operator % is the C modulus operator, which returns a
   remainder. For instance, 

                0 % 3 == 0
                1 % 3 == 1
                2 % 3 == 2
                3 % 3 == 0
                4 % 3 == 1
                ...

   the operator && is the boolean AND operator
*/

int comp(const void* p1, const void* p2) {
  const int* ptr1 = (const int*) p1;
  const int* ptr2 = (const int*) p2;

  if (*ptr1 % 2 == 0 && *ptr2 % 2 == 0) return 0;
  else return *ptr2 - *ptr1;
}

void dump(int a[ ], int n) {
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < 9; i++) printf("%i ", a[i]);
  printf("\n");
}

int main() {
  int a[ ] = {9, 4, 3, 7, 1, 8, 6, 2, 5};
  dump(a, 9);

  qsort(a, 9, sizeof(int), comp);
  dump(a, 9);
 
  return 0;
}
/* Here's the output:

    9 4 3 7 1 8 6 2 5
    9 8 7 4 6 5 3 2 1

   Explain how this output results from the qsort. Be as specific
   as possible. Hint: Start by carefully documenting qsort.
