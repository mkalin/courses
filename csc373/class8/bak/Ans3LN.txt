     6	Question 1:
     7	
     8	 The short version of an answer:
     9	
    10	 In the first qsort, we're qsorting an array of Emp elements. The sort is
    11	 "destructive" in that the elements themselves are moved in the array (that's
    12	 why I make a copy of the original way before sorting it). In the second
    13	 qsort, pointers to Emp elements are sorted. On my system
    14	
    15	       sizeof(Emp)  == 136
    16	       sizeof(Emp*) ==   4
    17	
    18	 In real life, an Emp would be considerably bigger; but, on a 32-bit machine,
    19	 an Emp* would still be 4 bytes. Rule 1 in efficient programming is not to
    20	 move data when you can move pointers to data. Basically, this is what a
    21	 reasonable relational database does: the rows of a table (e.g., Employee table)
    22	 are stored in arbitrary, unsorted order. Various indexes are then provided so
    23	 that the table can be displayed in various sorted orders (by name, by ID, by
    24	 salary, by department, etc.) A table index is, at the implementation level, an
    25	 array of pointers to rows in the (data) table.
    26	
    27	 Here's sample documentation of the 2nd comparison function:
    28	
    29	/* comp2 is used to sort an array of pointers; hence, comp2 receives
    30	   from qsort pointers to two elements that qsort needs to compare.
    31	   By requirement, the comp2 parameters must be of type
    32	
    33	              const void*
    34	
    35	   but, in reality, they are
    36	
    37	              const Emp**
    38	
    39	   or pointers to pointers to Emps. So the void* pointers are first
    40	   cast to what they really are, Emp**.
    41	
    42	   emp1 and emp2 are not pointers to Emps but pointers to pointers to
    43	   Emps
    44	
    45	           emp1--->some_ptr--->Emp
    46	
    47	   so we dereference, say, emp1
    48	
    49	           (*emp1)
    50	
    51	   which gives us
    52	
    53	           some_ptr
    54	
    55	   which we then use to access the Emp to which some_ptr points. The syntax
    56	   is
    57	            (*emp1)->lname
    58	
    59	   The parentheses are needed because -> is just as sticky as . and we want
    60	   to dereference emp1 to get at the pointer that points to the Employee.
    61	
    62	   The underlying comparison is the same as in comp1: create two
    63	   strings, each last_name + first_name, and compare them in
    64	   lexicographical order so that, for instance, "cruzandrea" precedes
    65	   "cruzhenry".
    66	*/
    67	int comp2(const void* item1, const void* item2) {
    68	  const Emp** emp1 = (const Emp**) item1;
    69	  const Emp** emp2 = (const Emp**) item2;
    70	
    71	  unsigned char buff1[BuffSize];
    72	  unsigned char buff2[BuffSize];
    73	
    74	  strcpy(buff1, (*emp1)->lname);

    85	Please answer each of the following and show your reasoning.
    86	
    87	 1. Cache C has 16 sets and is direct mapped, that is, it has
    88	    one block per set. Assume that the block holds only 1 word. In short,
    89	    we have 16 sets, each with one 8-bit block (or, if you like, one word
    90	    per block). Process P generates this reference string, each a word address:
    91	
    92		1, 4, 8, 5, 20, 17, 19, 56, 9, 11, 4, 43, 5, 6, 9, 17, 9, 56, 9
    93	
    94	    C is initially empty. For each memory reference above, label it as a
    95	    Hit or a Miss. Show C's contents after the last memory reference.
    96	
    97	    Assume that a word's cache address is its memory address modulo the
    98	    cache's size in sets (for example, the word at address 1 has cache address 
    99	    1 % 16 = 1; the word at address 19 has cache address 19 % 16 = 3; etc.)
   100	    So the word at address 1 goes into set 1, and so on.
   101	
   102	 
   103	**** Solution: I've broken the reference string into two lines for readability.
   104	               Above each memory address is H for HIT or M for MISS and below
   105	               each is the set to which it maps. A * (for example, S1*) indicates
   106	               that there's an explanation given below.
   107	  
   108	       Sets: S1, S2,...,Sa, Sb (Any numbering will do.)
   109	
   110	
   111	        Reference string (in two lines for readability):
   112	
   113	        M   M   M   M   M    M    M    M    M   M
   114		1,  4,  8,  5,  20,  17,  19,  56,  9, 11,  
   115	       S1  S4  S8  S5   S4   S1   S3   S8  S9  Sb
   116	
   117	        M  M    M   M    H   H     H  H     H
   118	        4, 43,  5,  6,   9,  17,   9, 56,   9
   119	       S4* S5  S5* S6   S9   S1   S9  S8   S9
   120	
   121	       Explanations:
   122	
   123	       S4* miss in second row: Address 20 in the first row also maps to S4,
   124	           displacing 4; hence, the second reference to 4 is also a MISS.
   125	
   126	       S5* miss in second row: Adddress 43 in the second row maps to S5,
   127	           displacing 5; hence, the second reference to 5 is also a MISS.
   128	
   129	
   130	
   131	 2. Use the same reference string as in question (1). However, this time 
   132	    assume that there are 4 sets and that C is 4-way set associative: there
   133	    are 4 sets, each with 4 blocks. A block still holds 1 word. The set address
   134	    is now the reference string number modulus 4. For instance, the first
   135	    number in the reference string is 1; hence, the word at address 1 goes into
   136	    set 1 % 4 == set 1. Here's a depiction of what a set looks like:
   137	
   138	            Si +----+----+----+----+
   139	               |    |    |    |    |
   140	               +----+----+----+----+
   141	                [0]  [1]   [2]  [3]
   142	
   143	    Each set is like an array of four elements, with element one of the words.
   144	    Now suppose a set is full and that a new element needs to come into the set.
   145	    Which element should be overwritten? Here are the rules:
   146	
   147	     -- Fill the set in left-to-right order, that is, index 0, then 1, then 2, then 3.
   148	
   149	     -- Keep track of the last entry. Suppose, for instance, that the set has been
   150	        full for some time and that the last entry was into [2]. The next entry would 
   151	        go into [3]. The next after that into [0]; and so on.
   152	
   153	    Write a program that simulates what happens to the cache with the reference string
   154	    from question (1). 
   155	
   156	    ;;
   157	    Below is a program together with the output. There are many ways to do this, of 
   158	    course; our outputs should agree.

   269	3. Use the same reference string as in question (1). Assume 
   270	   that cache C is 2-way set associative with 8 sets. Each block holds 1 word. 
   271	   Replacement is LRU (least recently used). A memory reference's cache set is the 
   272	   memory address modulus 8 (for example, the word at address 8 goes into set 0; 
   273	   the word at  address 11 goes into set 3; etc.) Do the same as in (1) and use the 
   274	   same assumptions as in (2).

   363	 4. Computer system S uses 32-bit virtual addresses as cache addresses. The cache 
   364	    address has three fields, left to right:
   365	
   366	                tag bits    set identifier    word offset
   367	
   368	    So how many bits are used in each field given 1,024 sets each with 8 lines. 
   369	    Each line contains 32 8-bit words. (A "line" is the same as a "block.")
   370	
   371	
   372	**** Solution:  The "log" used here is to base 2.
   373	
   374	                log(1024) == 10: so 10 bits for the set index
   375	
   376	                log(32) == 5: so 5 bits for the word offset
   377	
   378	                32 - (10 + 5) == 17 bits for the tag
   379	
   380	                The layout is:

   388	 5. A cache's total bit size is partitioned into "data bits" (that is, data or 
   389	    instructions) and "overhead bits" (bits for directory tags, the valid bit, 
   390	    the LRU bits, if used, and so on). For now, the only "overhead bits" of 
   391	    interest are the directory or tag bits. Consider two set-associative caches 
   392	    with the same capacity:
   393	
   394		C1: 2048 sets, 8 blocks per set, 32 words per block, 8 bits per word
   395	        C2: 4096 sets, 4 blocks per set, 32 words per block, 8 bits per word
   396	
   397	    Contrast the difference between "data bit" capacity and "overhead bit" size
   398	    for the two caches. Assume that the word offset is log(M) low-order 
   399	    (rightmost) bits, where M is the number of words per block; and that set 
   400	    address is the middle log(N) low-order bits, where N is the number of sets. 
   401	    The remaining (leftmost) bits are directory tags. Each set uses 32-bit 
   402	    addresses.
   403	
   404	
   405	**** Solution: "log" again means "log to base 2."
   406	
   407	       cache capacity in bits = 
   408	           sets * lines per set * words per line * bits per word
   409	       directory bits = sets * lines per set * tag bits per line
   410	
   411	       C1:   cache capacity in bits == 2048 * 8 * 32 * 8 == 4,194,304
   412	             So capacity in bits is about 4M.
   413	
   414	             set index == log(2048) == 11 bits
   415	             word offset == log(32) ==  5 bits
   416	             tag == 32 - (11 + 5) ==   16 bits
   417	
   418	             There are 2048 sets, each with 8 lines or blocks, each of which
   419	             has a 16-bit tag; so the total for the tags (the "directory") is
   420	             2048 * 8 * 16 == 262,144 or roughly 262K bits.
   421	
   422	             So the ratio is  262,144 / 4,194,304 or roughly 6.25%.
   423	
   424	       C2:   cache capacity in bits == 4096 * 4 * 32 * 8 = 4,194,304
   425	             set index == log(4096) == 12 bits
   426	             word offset == log(32) ==  5 bits
   427	             tag == 32 - (12 + 5) ==   15 bits
   428	
   429	             There are 4,096 sets, each with 4 lines, each of which has a 
   430	             15-bit tag; so the total for the directory is 
   431	             4096 * 4 * 15 == 245,750 or roughly 246K bits.
   432	
   433	             So the ratio is 245,750 / 4,194,304 or roughly 5.86%.
   434	
   435	       Circuitry considerations aside, C1 has only a slighly larger directory
   436	       but has twice as many lines into which a block of memory bytes can go.
   437	       In effect, the cost of the extra directory bits is insignificant given
   438	       the potential reduction in conflict misses (that is, misses that occur
   439	       when multiple memory addresses map to the same cache set). Of course,
   440	       C2 has twice as many sets --- and defenders of C2's design would argue
   441	       that the doubling of sets likewise reduces the potential for conflict
   442	       misses. C2 also lowers the overhead from about 6.25 to 5.86, which frees
   443	       up capacity space.
   444	
   445	       Conclusion: it's a hard call. You can see how cache designers would
   446	       agonize over these decisions.
   447	
   448	 6.  Consider the 32-bit virtual address 
   449	
   450	                   11110000 11110000 11110000 11110000
   451	
   452	     for an L2 cache with 4 blocks per set, 2048 sets, and 128 words per block. 
   453	     The address's low-order bits are on the right. Assume standard formatting for a 
   454	     cache address. (I've broken the address into four chunks of 8 bits apiece 
   455	     for readability only.)
   456	
   457	       1.  Mark the bits that give the word offset in the line.
   458	       2.  Mark the bits that specify the set.
   459	       3.  Mark the bits that constitute the tag or key.
   460	       4.  How many tags are in the directory as a whole?
   461	       5.  How many directory tags must be compared against this address’s tag bits 
   462	           when a cache lookup occurs?
   463	
   464	**** Solution:
   465	
   466	        Bits that mark the word offset have an 'o' above them.
   467	        Bits that mark the set index have an 's' above them.
   468	        Bits that mark the tag have a 't' above them.
   469	
   470	        log(1024) == 10     log(128) == 7    
   471	        Tag bits per line == 32 - (10 + 7) == 15
   472	
   473	              tttttttt ttttttts ssssssss sooooooo

   476	 7. Some cache designers are abandoning LRU as replacement policy and going instead
   477	    to random replacement. To see the problem, consider a 6-way set associative
   478	    cache with each block holding 1 word. Now consider this reference string for a
   479	    code segment in a loop:
   480	
   481	      1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13,...
   482	
   483	   
   484	    What problems does LRU cause given this reference string and our cache
   485	    capacity? (Assume that words enter the cache in the order in which they
   486	    arrive, for example, the word at address 1 goes into the first block in
   487	    a given set, the word at address 4 goes into the second slot, etc.) 
   488	
   489	    Make the case that random replacement would yield better performance than
   490	    does LRU for this reference string.
   491	
   492	**** From left to right I show history in a particular set line. I'm assuming
   493	     all words map to the same set but failed to say so in the question; hence,
   494	     you'll be graded on whatever assumption you made.
   495	
   496	     By assumption, all addresses map to the same set. After the word is either 
   497	     M for miss or H for hit (e.g., 1M means that the word at address 1 went in 
   498	     but was not already in).
   499	
   500	                1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13,...

   505	            L1: 1M                 13M                11M                 9M
   506	            L2:    4M                  1M                 13M                11M
   507	            L3:       7M                  4M                  1M                 13M
   508	            L4:          8M                  7M                  4M
   509	            L5:             9M                  8M                  7M             
   510	            L6:                11M                 9M                  8M
   511	
   512	
   513	  Conclusion: The "working set" of addresses is 
   514	
   515	                       1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13
   516	
   517	              and this repeats indefinitely. Under LRU, the word that gets kicked out
   518	              is the next word to be accessed. For example, the last word in the
   519	              working set is 13 and the first is 1; so, by definition, 1 is the
   520	              least recently used as it occurs only once before 13. So 13 kicks
   521	              out 1 in the cache. Immediately after 13 comes 1 again, which kicks
   522	              out 4, which comes next; and so on. Think of the working set as the
   523	              body of a loop that iterates thousands or even millions of times.
   524	              What a disaster!
   525	
   526	              If we just randomly selected one of the words to kick out, we
   527	              could not do any worse; indeed, there is then only a 1/6 chance that
   528	              we kick out the word needed next.
