                             Proposal to Change CSC373/CSC374 Division of Topics

# Overview

CSC373/374 currently require two textbooks:

    Hoover, System Programming with C and Unix
    Bryant/O'Hallaron, Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective

My proposal is to retain both books but to make CSC373 mostly a Hoover-based course
and CSC374 mostly a Bryant/O'Hallaron-based course.

# Motivation

I've taught CSC373, in Summer I, for several years using these texts. What's become clear is
that our DePaul students struggle mightily with programming in general and with C in particular.
In the current format, CSC373 introduces C and covers what, for most students, is the 
radically new material of Chapters 2 (internal representation), 3 (assembly language), and
6 (cache memory) in Bryant/O'Hallaron. 

I think that our students would be better served with a different focus in each course.
Under this proposal, CSC373 would cover:

   -- all of Hoover, with plenty of opportunity for instructive and interesting
      programs.

   -- Chapters 1 (overview) and 3 (assembly language) from Bryant/O'Hallaron.

Of course, the very nature of C would require some discussion of internal representation. 
For example, CSC373 might explain why shift operations are not allowed on floating-point
types, given the 3-field format of such types; but CSC373 would not go into the details
of IEEE 754, which instead would be covered in CSC374. 

In effect, CSC373 would become a systems programming course in C, including the full
preprocessing/compiling/linking phases of code translation. The course would introduce
debugging in C and assembly language, including assembly embedded in C programs. In CSC374,
C would be the programming language of choice but the emphasis would be on the material in
Bryant/O'Hallaron rather than on the programming issues and techniques in Hoover.
